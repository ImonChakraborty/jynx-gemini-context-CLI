![_f21c03eb-3920-44e5-b58f-59ba0e4a7a06](https://github.com/ImonChakraborty/jynx-gemini-context-CLI/assets/135951651/d8973ac2-c957-4a53-8510-92710588e5e9)


This is a command-line tool for generating text using generative AI. It leverages the power of Gemini 1.5 pro, a versatile language model trained by Google, to create natural language text. It uses a JSON file to keep track of the last 50 prompts and responses using a simple FIFO (First In First Out) technique, specifically a queue data structure to keep track of context while keeping the valuable token limit under control while conversing.

## Features

- **Text Generation**: Generate creative and coherent text based on prompts.
- **Usage of chat history**: Implementation of soft training data using chat history.
- **Context Awareness of last 50 conversations**: Adjust parameters like temperature and max length for varied output.
- **CLI Interface**: Easy-to-use command-line interface for quick and dynamic text generation with animation.

## To access it from Terminal in Windows

1. Open terminal:

     ```bash
     notepad $PROFILE
  
  if it is not available, refer to this video: https://youtu.be/E5tMwtoTd30?si=U7kVp21rw834Omqs

2. Paste this on $PROFILE:

     ```bash
     function jynx {python.exe "D:\programming\Python\TextGenAi.py" $args}

3. Save the powershell profile config and now you can use it on terminal itself:

3. If you use zsh:

      ```bash
      nano .zshrc

4. Write:

      ```bash
      alias jynx="python Documents/TextGenAi.py"

5. Save & exit, now you can use it natively like this:
